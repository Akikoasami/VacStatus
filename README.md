Usage
------

 - VacStatus is currently using `` Laravel 4.1.* ``
 - Please take a look at `` .gitignore `` because some files that are needed are missing
 - Go to `` http://steamcommunity.com/dev `` and get a Steam Web API Key and define `` $steamAPI `` with your Steam API key in `` app/controllers/BaseController.php ``
