#VacStatus
##Current State
Right now, the application is in progress of being developed.

You will need to run `npm install` and `composer install` to install all the dependencies.

Also you are assumed to know how to use `laravel 5`. No support will be given to install.

##API
VacStatus sort of has an API, you can take a look here. https://gist.github.com/jung3o/cc2ff73c64e2933828c5
If you look at the jsx, you can have access to a lot more. Just nothing that is related to changing the private key.
